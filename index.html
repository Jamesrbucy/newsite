                <p>I, am James Bucy. I have been working to become a professional developer, but now, I am a cat. It wasnt always this way. Originally, at this point on this webpage, I was supposed to be telling you more about my career, my life, and who I am. but as you can see, I am most certainly a cat, and this is a full time career, and the end goal at the same time.What more shall I say? will it seem vain of me, as this wonderous creature to speak more of my many feats? </p>
